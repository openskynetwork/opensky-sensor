This is the Opensky Daemon (OpenSkyD), a program running on a radarcape,
relaying ADS-B frames to the OpenSky collector server.
It is meant as a replacement for rcd, although there is a possiblity for
interwork with rcd.

See README.md for more information on the features.

Configuration
The project is a standard autotools project.
For configure, there are several flags to specify the flavors to be built and
the features to be included.
* --enable-uart[=yes]         build the UART flavor. This is the default and
                              meant for using the radarcape standalone, i.e.
                              without the rcd.
* --enable-network[=no]       build the network flavor. It will read the
                              frames from an rcd over (local) network.
* --enable-dummy[=no]         build the dummy flavor. It will generate frames
                              for testing.
* --enable-wd[=no]            build the watchdog flavor. It will not read any
                              frames but only trigger the watchdog.
* --enable-development[=no]   enables building all flavors for development.
                              This means, that configuration files are
                              searched within the current directory.
* --enable-test-coverage[=no] Build tests for using them with gcov.
* --enable-cleanup[=yes]      Add cleanup routines when exiting the daemon.
                              Especially meant for testing with valgrind etc.
* --enable-talkback[=yes]     Add interpreting commands from the server.
* --with-systemd[=auto]       Enable systemd specific code when forking.
* --with-pacman[=auto]        Enable pacman specific commands.

Requirements
* check                       Needed for make test.
* pacman (optional)           Needed for upgrading itself.
