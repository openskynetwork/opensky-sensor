This is the OpenSky Daemon (OpenSkyD), a program running on a radarcape,
relaying ADS-B frames to the OpenSky collector server.
It is meant as a replacement for rcd, although there is a possiblity for
interwork with rcd.

See README.md for more information on the features.

Configuration
The project is a standard autotools project.
For configure, there are several flags to specify the flavors to be built and
the features to be included.
* --enable-input[=uart]       select input layer. One of uart, network, dummy or
                              none.
* --enable-standalone[=yes]   build features needed only for standalone daemon
                              (i.e. not needed for interacting with rcd).
* --enable-wd[=no]            build the watchdog flavor. It will not read any
                              frames but only trigger the watchdog.
* --enable-development[=no]   enables building for development. This means, that
                              configuration files are expected within the
                              current directory.
* --enable-test-coverage[=no] Build tests for using them with gcov.
* --enable-cleanup[=yes]      Add cleanup routines when exiting the daemon.
                              Especially meant for testing with valgrind etc.
* --enable-talkback[=yes]     Add interpreting commands from the server.
* --with-systemd[=auto]       Enable systemd specific code when forking.
* --with-pacman[=auto]        Enable pacman specific commands.

Requirements
* check (optional)            Needed for make test.
* pacman (optional)           Needed for upgrading itself.
