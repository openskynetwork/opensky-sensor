This is the OpenSky Daemon (OpenSkyD), which serves as an intermediate
component between an ADSB receiver and the OpenSky Network, relaying ADS-B
frames to the OpenSky collector server.
It is supposed to run on the user side.

There are several products which are built from this common code basis:
 * radarcape-standalone: builds a binary which is a replacement for rcd (the
    radarcape daemon), originally running on radarcapes.
    It makes sure, that the FPGA is configured, the watchdog is triggered and
    receives frames directly from the receiver running on the FPGA via UART.
    It also features administrative commands in the talkback channel to open a
    reverse shell.
 * radarcape-network: builds a binary which connects to rcd (running on a stock
    radarcape) over network.
 * radarcape-dummy: builds a binary which creates random frames for testing
    purposes.
 * radarcape-library: builds a library which is intended to be integrated into
    stock rcd. There is also the possibility to build some examples using that
    library for testing purposes.

Configuration
The project is a standard autotools project.
For configure, there are several flags to specify the binaries and libraries to
be built and the features to be included.
* --enable-radarcape-standalone[=no]
                                  build the standalone opensky daemon
* --enable-radarcape-network[=no]
                                  build the opensky daemon for connecting to rcd
                                  over network
* --enable-radarcape-dummy[=no]   build the opensky daemon with dummy input
* --enable-watchdog-daemon[=no]   build a standalone watchdog daemon for the
                                  radarcape
* --enable-radarcape-library[=no]
                                  build the radarcape library for rcd
                                  integration
* --enable-library-examples[=no]  build rcd integration
* --enable-local-files[=no]       enables building for development. This means,
                                  that configuration files are expected within
                                  the current working directory
* --enable-test-coverage[=no]     build tests for using them with gcov
* --enable-cleanup-routines[=yes]
                                  Add cleanup routines when exiting the daemon.
                                  Especially meant for testing with valgrind etc
* --with-systemd[=auto]           Enable systemd specific code when forking
* --with-pacman[=auto]            Enable pacman specific commands

Requirements
* check (optional)                Needed for make test
* pacman (optional)               Needed for upgrading itself
